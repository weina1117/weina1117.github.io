Chapter 1 Fundamentals
----------------------

This chapter will cover these five main topics:

### 1.1 Basic Programming Model

### 1.2 Data Abstraction

### 1.3 Bags, Queues and Stacks

### 1.4 Analysis of Algorithms


1.1 Basic Programming Model
---------------------------

```sequence

Java Program ->: Library of Static Methods 

Java Program ->: Data-type Definition

```

A java program(class) is either a library of static methods(functions) or 
a data type definition.

```sequence
Java basic structure -> Primitive Data type:
Java basic structure -> Statements:
Java basic structure -> Arrays:
Java basic structure -> Strings:
Java basic structure --> Static Method:
Java basic structure --> Data Abstraction:
Java basic structure --> Standard I/O:
```

##### Primitive Data type

> long:
>
> int:
>
> double:
>
> boolean:
>
> char:
>
> long:
>
> short:
>
> byte:

##### Statement

> Declaration:
>
> Assignment:
>
> Conditional:
>
> Loops:
>
> Call and Return:

> 
> Simply to remember is:
>
> 1. Initializing declaration
>
> 2. Implicit Assignments
>
>    a = ++i that means i = i + 1; a = i
>
>    a = i++ that means a = i; i = i + 1
>
> 3. Single - Statement blocks
>

##### Arrays

> * stores a sequence of same type values, once we want to use one value of them, 
>   number and index them
> * To create a new array through the keyword *new* at the run time.
> * Don't omit anyone step!! 
>   Following: declaring, creating and initializing.

```sh

```


##### Static Methods



##### Standard I/O
