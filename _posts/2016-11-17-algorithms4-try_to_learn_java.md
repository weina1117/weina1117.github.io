title: starting with java cases in princeton algs4 on iterm
---

I'm at very begining. The first thing I learnt is managing the Java classpath after classpass set up. Classpath is the connection between the java runtime and the filesystem. It defines where the interpreter looks forclass files to load. the command "echo $Classpath" means that to find the compiled files through the name. So, here we need to add the path manually that's our first import.
* First, get the java file through wget command
* enter the file and first import files(eg: edu.princeton.cs.algs4.all)
  and then read the java files through javac command and create the java class file.

Note:
"." before the dot that is the package, after the dot that is the complied java class file.
