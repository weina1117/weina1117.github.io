1.1 Information Is Bits + Content
---------------------------------

* hello program begins life as a source program, and this source program is 
  a text file. Each source file is a sequence of bits that included by 0
  and 1, it will present some characters by ASCII. That means each byte will
  be represent by an unique byte-size integer valuer.

* A set of bits could stands for any information in system. We can through
  the content to disdinguish the different bits.

1.2 Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms
------------------------------------------------------------------

Four phase:
* Preprocessor
  To revise C program according to the command start with \`#\`

* Compiler
  Translate `hello.i` to `hello.s`, which contains an
 ` assembly-language` prgram.

* Assembler
  Translate `hello.s` to computer commands, and package it to `hello.o`.  

* Linker
  Get the exacute `hello` file after merging two files.

1.3 It Pays to Understand How Compilation Systems Work
------------------------------------------------------

Important to understand how compilation system work for the programmers.
* Optimizing program performance
* Understanding link-time errors
* Avoiding security holes

1.4 Processors Read and Interpret Instructions Stored in Memory
---------------------------------------------------------------

##### 1.4.1 Hardware Organization of a System

![sample post]({{site.baseurl}}/images/1.4.png)

* Buses
  A collection of electrical conduits. It running throughout the system 
  to carry bytes of information.

* I/O Devices
  Four components: a keyboard, a mouse, a display and a disk drive.
  Through controllers or adapter to connecting with I/O buses.

* Main Memory
  temporay storage

* Processor 
  CPU: central processing unit
  ALU: arithmetic/logic unit
  PC: program counter

##### 1.4.2 Running the hello Program

* Read the hello command from keyboard:

* Shell get the command from the keyboard

* Code and data load to main memory from disk that process exacuted by shell
![sample post]({{site.baseurl}}/images/1.6.png)

* The output string will be write to the display from main memory,
  CPU will exacute this process.

1.5 Cacher Matter
-----------------

Time-consuming:
looding program: information copied from disk to main memory
 runing program: information copied from main memory into the processor.

To deal with the processor-memory gap:

1.6 Storage Devices Form a Hierarchy
------------------------------------

Here we can hit the poit to impove performance.

1.7 The Operating System Manages the Hardware
---------------------------------------------

How does operating system looks like:

##### 1.7.1 Process

It's an abstraction of operating system running program.
![sample post]({{site.baseurl}}/images/1.12.png)

(need to go over P53 again)

##### 1.7.2 Threads

Multiple execution units within one process called threads.
Each thread is running in context switching.
They sharing the same code and globale data.(easier than process)

##### 1.7.3 Virtual Memory

* program code and data
  starting at the same fixed address for all processes
 
* Heap
  At the begining, assigned the size to heap. 
  It expands and constacts dynamically at run time.

* shared libraries
  An arear sharing the code and data.

* stack
  Store the information when calls function.  

* Kernel virtual memory
  The top region of the address spaces is reserved for kernel.

##### 1.7.4 Files
 
A sequence of bytes. It provides applications with a uniform view of 
all the varied I/O device that might be contained in the system.

1.8 Systems Communicate with Other Systems Using Networks
---------------------------------------------------------

The network can be viewed as just another I/O device. The system can read
data sent from other machines and copy these data to its main memory over
a network.

1.9 Important Themes
--------------------

##### 1.9.1 Adahl's Law

Insightful obervation about the effectiveness of improving the performace
of one part of a system. Amdahl made this observation called Amdahl's Law.





##### 1.9.2 Concurrency and Parallelism


##### 1.9.3 The Importance of Abstraction in Computer System
